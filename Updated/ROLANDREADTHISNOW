Added an instance variable gameStart to classes Player & Prompt. This prevents text from appearing with the introduction, but allows it to appear as normally afterwards

In inventory menu, options "View Weapon" and "View Armor" now notify the user if there is nothing to display.

Replaced instances of text display "Exit" with "Return to menu" in the case where "Exit" did not exit the system.

Options menu "Quit Game" option changed to "Exit". Original "Exit" option removed.

In the travel menu, option "5) Return to Menu" added. Self-explanatory purpose.
